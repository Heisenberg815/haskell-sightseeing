Discovering Haskell wonders

In this repository, I propose solutions for the assignements of the excellent [cis-194](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) Haskell course.

This is currently a work in progress, only the homeworks 1, 2, 3 are completed.

PS: The optional exercices won't be tackled (at least not at first).

PS2: The solutions exposed here are certainly not the most elegant nor the most efficient, but they are the best I could come up with in a reasonable amount of time.
(Note: I did not have any Haskell experience prior to this.). Any constructive feedback is welcome.
